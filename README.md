# random_function_research
Motivation
-----------
This project is an exploration of how random is computed at a fundamental level. 

It ended up being a really interesting endeavor.

Chart
---------

Red = my_rand || Blue = numpy.randint

*early version

Goal
-----------
- Have LCG Algorithm compete with Numpy's random
- Perform statistical test on algorithm
  - Spectral Test
  - Some Diehard Tests
